# Pebble & Granite development log

## Current state

Foundation work started 25 October 2026. Original repository contained the design
bible only. Remote: `maccam912/pebble_and_granite`, main branch.

## Work order

- [x] Initial deterministic arithmetic/physics/ice and versioned single-shot replay contracts.
- [x] Initial Godot delivery/sweep lab with unified pointer/touch event routes.
  Native runtime checked; Android package/device checks remain pending.
- [ ] Rules boundaries and mixed-doubles turn ownership.
- [ ] Authority/input validation and multiplayer transport proof.
- [ ] CI cross-platform tests, native builds, Godot exports and numbered releases.
- [ ] Local and remote integration checks; calibration and performance reports.

## Owner follow-up / gates

- Real curlers must evaluate throw and sweeping feel; record device and ice profile.
- Collision coefficients and path wear need measurements, not invented certainty.
- Physical Android testing and publisher/store signing remain separate gates.
- Career, full team roles, polished art/audio, advanced AI and public hosting follow
  the feel slice. Missing roadmap embeds are replaced by the explicit work order.

## Usage checkpoints

- Start: weekly 4% used / 96% remaining. Continue until remaining is below 50%,
  checking at milestones. No reset or paid usage purchase is authorized.


## Milestone 1 — initial feel lab

- `61fbf53`: fixed-point core and architectural decisions pushed to main.
- 21 Rust tests pass: arithmetic, sqrt/PRNG/hash vectors, contacts, snapshots,
  sweep carry, hostile release/replay boundaries and device-neutral stroke input.
- Godot 4.7 native window and headless lab integration passed on macOS ARM64.
  Captured and inspected `build/evidence/lab.png` (ignored local artifact).
- First editor import crashed at shutdown; repeat import and runtime both passed.
  Keep watching the pinned editor rather than claiming the crash was explained.
- Unswept 2.05 m/s probe: 24.67 seconds, 0.91 m curl, 2.79 turns; sweep adds 1.34 m.
  Swept absolute curl is not yet lower, so sweep/curl calibration needs work.
- Lab currently uses overhead views, accessible hold sweeping, one stone/reset,
  and no hidden release noise. Real scrubbing, persistent ice across throws,
  full delivery body/slide model, interpolation and 3D cameras are next steps.
- Rules crate is reserved but unimplemented; server CLI verifies replays only.
  No multiplayer feature is claimed yet. Four-character Iroh rooms remain planned.
- CI and desktop/Android package configuration authored; remote result pending.
- Usage checkpoint: 5% used / 95% remaining.

## Milestone 2 — authority/rules and first remote gates

- `29cc46c` pushed the playable lab, replay checker and release workflow.
- GitHub run 40240006046: all four core jobs passed (Linux, Windows, macOS ARM64,
  macOS Intel), including every-tick canonical traces. Initial package jobs failed:
  Android setup requested removed SDK package `tools`; Linux encountered first-import
  GDExtension editor shutdown race. Fixes use explicit platform-tools and the upstream
  documented frame-delay workaround (godotengine/godot#111048), with a fresh-cache
  reproduction test. A preloaded extension cache also passed, but is not the chosen fix.
- Development Android keystore is stored outside the repo under
  `~/.local/share/pebble-and-granite/signing/` and in the repository Actions secret.
- Added 10 rules tests and 5 transport-independent authority tests. Mixed doubles
  matches/positioned stones are not yet exposed in the lab; no online product claim.
- 2026 rulebook URL returned 403. Rules currently implement the supplied bible;
  complete clause audit (including changed 2026 positioned guard locations) remains.
- Authority admits one brush stream per team in this slice, validates ownership,
  deduplicates per tick/team, allows a 100 ms late-input window, and retimes older
  samples to arrival. Opponent sweeping cannot be retroactively authorized by a
  later tee crossing. Full role-specific multi-brush play is deferred.

## Model 2 — contact sign and sweep behavior

- Added physical spin-transfer direction/energy and packed-chain separation tests.
  They caught a reversed tangential contact sign; corrected before gameplay grows.
- Increased provisional sweep curl suppression so the same release goes longer
  **and** straighter: swept x=0.824 m vs unswept x=0.910 m, +1.347 m carry.
- Simulation version is now 2; metadata lives in compatibility.json and CI checks
  it against Rust constants. Old model replays are rejected rather than reinterpreted.
- Golden traces now cover three seeded draws, sweeping, reverse turn and runback.
- Initial Android setup and editor import fixes are rerunning remotely. Windows
  executable-name and Android host-extension import fixes are in `2e4ca7f`.
- Local universal macOS bridge compiled for ARM64/x64. Full template download is
  unusually slow locally; no local packaged macOS result is claimed yet.
