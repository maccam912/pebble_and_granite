# Presentation review — 26 October 2026

Scope: polish the existing practice, local setup and online screens toward a
photographic club presentation. No gameplay, rules, physics or network contracts
change. Keep touch, trackpad and the accessible sweep button.

## Baseline critique

Fresh native Compatibility captures in `build/evidence/visual-baseline/` showed
cyan, featureless ice; spherical grey rocks with square handles; very dark empty
walls; floating ring geometry; and default buttons without hierarchy. Instructions
partly covered the stone. Long release reports could exceed the fixed panel.

Visual references (viewed for material/shape reference only, not redistributed):

- [Campbellton Curling Club photography](https://www.campbelltoncurling.com/history)

Recommended order: correct the stone profile and materials, bring the rink into
a neutral photographic palette, add the missing architectural finish and fixture
reflections, then improve menu hierarchy and clear the delivery sightline.

## First iteration

- Original lathed stone body, polished crown, rough striking band, rounded molded
  team handles and restrained contact shadows. One original generated granite
  texture, with provenance/prompt in `assets/textures/README.md`, stored in LFS.
- One continuous ice shader, including antialiased painted rings/lines, subtle
  pebble, cloudy ice and fine scratches. No layered floating ring cylinders.
- Finished walls, windows, benches, sheet signs, ceiling and three rows of strip
  fixtures, sharing cached materials. A static reflection probe excludes the
  moving stones. Eight soft indoor spotlights retained.
- Shared menu theme with deliberate hover, press, disabled and keyboard focus
  states; warm primary actions, quieter secondary actions and distinct sweep
  controls. Existing match/online controls retain their behavior.
- Separate branding/status hierarchy, aligned footer actions, and an instruction
  panel that sizes to the actual wrapped text and clears the delivery handle.

Rendered critique led to lower specular strength and light energy after the
first pass looked wet/overexposed, removal of a tone mapper that crushed the walls,
and a shorter room-code placeholder after a native screenshot showed clipping.

## Reproduce the review

```sh
git lfs pull
python3 tools/build_native.py
python3 tools/godot.py --headless --path . --editor --import --quit
python3 tools/godot.py --path . --script tools/visual_review.gd
```

The fixture does not save, contact other players or create a directory entry.
It captures delivery, slide feedback, a six-stone material fixture, overhead
house, match setup, lobby and validation feedback in `build/evidence/polish/`.
The six-stone arrangement is a presentation fixture, not evidence of a simulated
match. Images/logs stay in ignored `build/`; no screenshot binaries enter Git.

Validation for the first pass: core/golden traces and the existing Godot rink,
input routing, analog delivery, held resume, spatial sweeping, online UI, match
flow, practice restore and match restore gates pass locally. The rendered review
checks report containment and compiles the shaders on native OpenGL Compatibility.
A native rink test lost brush input during one focus interruption; the subsequent
native run and headless input gates passed. No physical Android or other GPU
performance claim follows from the Mac captures. Cross-platform CI is separate.
